## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **ImportError: No module named 'notifications'**
   - Make sure `'notifications'` is added to `INSTALLED_APPS`
   - Restart your Django server

2. **Signals not working**
   - Check that `notifications.signals` is imported in `apps.py`
   - Verify the `ready()` method is implemented in `NotificationsConfig`

3. **JWT Authentication errors**
   - Ensure you're sending the correct Bearer token
   - Check if your JWT token hasn't expired

4. **No notifications being created**
   - Check Django logs for any signal errors
   - Verify that the triggering events (video upload, etc.) are actually happening
   - Make sure there are enrolled students in the course
